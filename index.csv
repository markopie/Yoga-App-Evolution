27,Dhanurasana,Dhanurāsana,101,4,,63,,75,"27 / Dhanurasana
Technique
Lie full length on the floor on the stomach, face downwards.

Exhale and bend the knees. Stretch the arms back and hold the left ankle with the left hand and the right ankle with the right hand. Take two breaths.

Now exhale completely and pull the legs up by raising the knees above the floor, and simultaneously lift the chest off the floor. The arms and hands act like a bow-string to tauten the body like a bent bow. (Image 63)

Lift up the head and pull it as far back as possible. Do not rest either the ribs or the pelvic bones on the floor. Only the abdomen bears the weight of the body on the floor.

In this posture the spine is stretched back. Elderly people do not normally do this, so their spines get rigid. This asana brings back elasticity to the spine and tones the abdominal organs. In my experience, persons suffering from slipped discs have obtained relief by the regular practice of Dhanurasana and Salabhasana (Image 60) without being forced to rest or to undergo surgical treatment.
Stretches the spine backward, restores spinal elasticity (preventing rigidity in elderly), tones abdominal organs, provides non-surgical relief for slipped discs.

It is the best of bandhas, and he who constantly practices it, as taught by his guru, becomes young again.
It exercises the diaphragm.
Through uddiyana bandha the great bird prana is forced to fly up through the sushumna nadi, the main channel for the flow of nervous energy, which is situated inside the spinal column (merudanda).",,,"When clarity is gained, doubts vanish, bringing illumination.
Silence in the body will bring about silence in the mind.
Each out-breath takes the sadhaka's mind towards his own self and purges his brain of all its tensions and activities.
The fluctuations of the mind and the intellect cease, the 'I' or ego disappears.
His being then gets merged in the Infinite (Paramatma).
Savasana provides an experience of unalloyed bliss.
The body is at rest as in deep sleep, the senses as in dream but the intellect alert and aware.
Complete serenity of the body is the first requisite, and it is the first sign of attaining spiritual tranquillity.
Exhalation is the best form of surrender by the sadhaka of his all - his breath, life, and soul to his Creator.",
202,Nauli,Nauli,,16,,595-596,,357,"202. Nauli (Images 595 and 596)
The word Nauli is not found in standard dictionaries. Ullola meaning a large wave or surge, conveys some idea of the process of Nauli where the abdominal muscles and organs are made to move laterally and vertically in a surging motion. Nau means a boat and li to cling to, lie on, hide or cover. The pitching of a boat on a stormy sea conveys some idea of the process of Nauli.

Nauli is a kriya or process and not an asana. Care should be observed in its performance, otherwise the process leads to numerous diseases. It is not, therefore, recommended for the average practitioner. First master Uddiyana Bandha before attempting Nauli, which is described in the Gheranda Samhita under the name Lauliki.

Technique

Stand in Tadasana. (Image 1)

Spread the legs a foot apart, bend slightly at the knees and stoop forward.

Place the hands with the fingers spread wide on the thighs just above the knees.

Lower the head until the chin rests in the notch between the collar-bones on the top of the breast-bone.

Inhale deeply, then exhale quickly so that all the air is forced from the lungs in a rush.

Hold the breath (without any inhalation). Pull the whole abdominal region back towards the spine.

The area between the pelvic rim and the floating ribs on both sides of the abdomen should be made passive to create hollowness there. At the same time push the abdominal recti forward. (Image 595 front view; and Image 596 side view)

Maintain this position from 5 to 10 seconds, according to your capacity.

Relax the grip on the recti and go back to the position described in para. 6 above.

Relax the abdomen and inhale slowly.

Take a few deep breaths. Repeat the cycle in paras 1 to 10 above, six to eight times at a stretch only once every 24 hours.

Practise Nauli on an empty stomach after evacuating the bladder and bowels.

Effects The abdominal recti are strengthened. The other effects of Nauli are the same as those of Uddiyana Bandha.",,,,

Sit in any comfortable position like Padmasana (Image 104), Siddhasana (Image 84) or Virasana (Image 89).

Keep the back erect and rigid. Lower the head to the trunk. Rest the chin in the notch between the collar-bones just above the breast-bone. (This is the Jalandhara Bandha.)

Stretch the arms out straight and rest the back of the wrists on the knees. Join the tips of the index fingers to the tips of the thumbs, keeping the other fingers extended. (This position or gesture of the hand is known as the Jñāna Mudra, the symbol or seal of knowledge. The index finger symbolises the individual soul and the thumb the Universal Soul. The union of the two symbolises knowledge.)

Close the eyes and look inwards. (Image 597)

Exhale completely.

Now the Ujjayi method of breathing begins.

Take a slow, deep steady breath through both nostrils. The passage of the incoming air is felt on the roof of the palate and makes a sibilant sound (sa). This sound should be heard.

Fill the lungs up to the brim. Care should be taken not to bloat the abdomen in the process of inhalation. (Observe this in all the types of Pranayama.) This filling up is called pūraka (inhalation).

The entire abdominal area from the pubes up to the breast-bone should be pulled back towards the spine.

Hold the breath for a second or two. This internal retention is called antara kumbhaka. Observe Mūla Bandha as described on p. 366.

Exhale slowly, deeply and steadily, until the lungs are completely empty. As you begin to exhale, keep your grip on the abdomen. After two or three seconds of exhalation, relax the diaphragm gradually and slowly. While exhaling the passage of the outgoing air should be felt on the roof of the palate. The brushing of the air on the palate should make an aspirate sound (ha). This exhalation is called rechaka.

Wait for a second before drawing a fresh breath. This waiting period is called bāhya kumbhaka.

The process described from para. 7 to para. 12 completes one cycle of Ujjayi Pranayama.

Repeat the cycles for 5 to 10 minutes keeping the eyes closed throughout.

Effects Aerates the lungs, removes phlegm, gives endurance, soothes the nerves, and tones the entire system. When done without retention (kumbhaka) in a reclining position, it is beneficial for high blood pressure and coronary troubles.

Note: ","1. Spread a blanket, folded lengthwise, on the floor. Over it, at the head and exactly in line with the edge, lay another blanket folded three or four times so that it fits the back of the head and trunk. 2. Lie flat on the back on the folded blanket, keeping the body in a straight line. Do not cave in the rib-cage. Close the eyes and lie quietly for a minute or two. 3. Cover the eyes with a soft cloth for quick relaxation of the facial muscles. 4. Breathe normally. Consciously observe and feel the flow of breath throughout. 5. As you breathe in, make sure that both lungs fill evenly. Feel the chest expand upwards and outwards. Synchronize the two movements. 6. Breathe out quietly, emptying the lungs evenly on both sides. Correct it if the lungs move unevenly. 7.

Constriction in the abdomen, pressure at the temples or gasping for air indicate that you have reached your capacity in external retention (bahya kumbhaka), in which case reduce the length of the retention. Never breathe in during uddiyana bandha, as this may make you gasp and strain the heart.","Breath is received as a divine gift and should not be drawn in forcefully.

Exhale slowly, deeply and steadily, until the lungs are completely empty. As you begin to exhale, keep your grip on the abdomen. After two or three seconds of exhalation, relax the diaphragm gradually and slowly. While exhaling the passage of the outgoing air should be felt on the roof of the palate. The brushing of the air on the palate should make an aspirate sound (ha). This exhalation is called rechaka.

Wait for a second before drawing a fresh breath. This waiting period is called bāhya kumbhaka.

The process described from para. 7 to para. 12 completes one cycle of Ujjayi Pranayama.

Repeat the cycles for 5 to 10 minutes keeping the eyes closed throughout.

Effects Aerates the lungs, removes phlegm, gives endurance, soothes the nerves, and tones the entire system. When done without retention (kumbhaka) in a reclining position, it is beneficial for high blood pressure and coronary troubles.

Note: ","1. Lie as described in Stage I, then follow the instructions given in Stage II. 2. Relax the diaphragm and stretch it sideways while you breathe in, without inflating the abdomen. To prevent this, do not allow the diaphragm to roll or to move above the floating ribs. 3. Take slow, deep, steady and sibilant in-breath carefully through the nose. Make sure that both lungs fill evenly. 4. Listen to the sound attentively, and maintain its rhythm throughout. 5. Fill the lungs completely till the sound of inhalation becomes inaudible. 6. Deep inhalation tends to move the eye-balls up. Consciously draw them down and gaze into the lungs. 7. At the start of exhalation immobilize the diaphragm; then breathe out slowly but not deeply. Here the out-breath will be slightly longer than normal. 8. Continue in the same way for ten minutes; then relax.","If hardness is felt in the lungs, or tension in and around the temples or in the head, it is a sign that you are exceeding your capacity; if so, reduce the length of the internal retention. Constriction in the abdomen, pressure at the temples or gasping for air indicate that you have reached your capacity in external retention (bahya kumbhaka), in which case reduce the length of the retention. Never breathe in during uddiyana bandha, as this may make you gasp and strain the heart.","Breath is received as a divine gift and should not be drawn in forcefully.

Exhale completely.

Now the Ujjayi method of breathing begins.

Take a slow, deep steady breath through both nostrils. The passage of the incoming air is felt on the roof of the palate and makes a sibilant sound (sa). This sound should be heard.

Fill the lungs up to the brim. Care should be taken not to bloat the abdomen in the process of inhalation. (Observe this in all the types of Pranayama.) This filling up is called pūraka (inhalation).

The entire abdominal area from the pubes up to the breast-bone should be pulled back towards the spine.

Note: ","1. Sit in any comfortable position, following the techniques given in Stage V and exhale whatever breath is in the lungs. 2. Take a slow, deep, steady in-breath through the nose. 3. Listen to the sibilant sound of the breath. Control, adjust and synchronize its flow, tone and rhythm. The flow is controlled by the resonance of the sound and the tone by the flow. This is the key to success in pranayama. 4. Fill the lungs from the bottom to the top, right up to the collar-bones. Consciously try to channel the breath to the remotest parts of the lungs. 5. Be continuously aware of the inflow of breath. 6. As you breathe in, your body, lungs, brain and consciousness should be receptive rather than active. Breath is received as a divine gift and should not be drawn in forcefully. 7. Do not inflate the abdomen as you inhale. Keep the diaphragm below the ribs throughout. Observe this type of pranayama. If the diaphragm is lifted above the floating ribs, the abdomen gets inflated instead of the chest. 8. The movements described above are made by drawing the entire abdominal area from the pubis to the breastbone towards the spine and then up towards the head. This automatically massages the internal organs. 9. In deep inhalation, the inner intercostal muscles at the front are lifted up. Just before exhalation, there is a further lift of these muscles, which prepares one before breathing out. 10. Now begins the process of deep exhalation, in which the trunk and diaphragm play an active role. 11. Maintain the lift of the intercostal muscles along with that of the diaphragm and start exhalation. Allow the breath to go out slowly, deeply and steadily. 12. After a few seconds, the grip of the trunk relaxes by itself gradually until the lungs have been passively emptied. Maintain continuous awareness during the out-flow of breath. 13. This completes one cycle. Repeat for ten to fifteen minutes keeping the eyes closed and the limbs relaxed. Inhale and then lie down and rest in Savasana. 14. Inhale with warmth, elation and joy as if you are receiving the life force. 15. Exhale with a sense of gratitude, silently expressing your humbleness as surrender to the Lord. 16. At each inhalation and exhalation there is a fractional pause when the muscles of the torso adjust themselves. Learn to be aware of this.","If hardness is felt in the lungs, or tension in and around the temples or in the head, it is a sign that you are exceeding your capacity; if so, reduce the length of the internal retention.

Keeping the right nostril completely blocked, open the left nostril partially and exhale through it slowly and deeply (rechaka).

During the exhalation regulate the rhythmic flow of air from the left nostril by adjusting pressure with the ring and little fingers, so that the outer edge of the left nostril is kept parallel to the septum. The pressure should be exerted from the inner sides of the tips of the fingers (away from the nails).

This completes one cycle of Sūrya Bhedana Prānāyāma. Continue with more cycles at a stretch from 5 to 10 minutes, according to capacity.

All the inhalations in Sūrya Bhedana are from the right nostril and all the exhalations from the left nostril.

Throughout the process, the passage of air is felt at the tips of the fingers and the thumbs and in the nasal membranes where pressure is applied. The passage of air makes a sound similar to air escaping from a cycle tube. This sound should be maintained constant throughout by varying pressure on the nostrils.

The eyes, temples, eyebrows and the skin on the forehead should remain completely passive and show no sign of strain.

The mind should be absorbed completely in listening to the proper sound of the passage of air and in maintaining a proper rhythm in breathing.

Each inhalation and exhalation should last for the same length of time.

The inhalation and the exhalation should not be forced. An even and slow rhythm should be maintained throughout.

Stage (j) is the safety measure to be observed after the completion of the cycles in order to prevent gasping, breathlessness and strain on the heart.

Do 8 to 10 cycles at a stretch as described above. This may take 6 or 8 minutes.

Inhalation and exhalation from each side should take the same time. In the beginning the duration will be unequal. Persevere until equality is achieved.

After achieving mastery over the equal duration and precision over inhalation and exhalation on either side an attempt may be made to retain breath (antara kumbhaka) after inhaling.

This precision is only achieved after long practice.

Retention should not disturb the rhythm and equality of inhalation and exhalation. If either are disturbed curtail the period of retention or hold the breath on alternate cycles.

During retention after inhalation practise Mūla Bandha (see p. 366).

Do not attempt to hold the breath after exhalation (bāhya kumbhaka, Image 600) until you have mastered retention after inhalation (antara kumbhaka). Then during bāhya kumbhaka practise Uddiyana (Images 593, 594) with Mūla Bandha (see p. 366).

Readjust them on the outer edge of the left nostril and keep it parallel to the septum. Exhale slowly, steadily and deeply through the left nostril. Empty the lungs completely. The pressure should be exerted from the inner sides of the tips of the ring and little fingers (away from the nails) (rechaka).

After full exhalation through the left nostril, change the pressure on it by adjusting the fingers. In the changed position, the tips of the ring and little fingers nearer the nails exert the pressure.

Now inhale through the left nostril slowly, steadily and deeply, filling the lungs to the brim (pūraka).

After full inhalation through the left nostril, block it and exhale through the right nostril, adjusting the pressure of the right thumb on the right nostril as stated in para. 2 above (rechaka).

This completes one cycle of Nāḍī Śodhana Prānāyāma. Here the rhythm of breathing is as follows: a. Exhale through the right nostril. b. Inhale through the right nostril. c. Exhale through the left nostril. d. Inhale through the left nostril. e. Exhale through the right nostril. f. Inhale through the right nostril. g. Exhale through the left nostril. h. Inhale through the left nostril. i. Exhale through the right nostril. j. Inhale through the right nostril ... and so on.

Stage (a) above is the preparatory one. The first real Nāḍī Śodhana Prānāyāma cycle starts at stage (b) and ends at stage (e). The second cycle starts at stage (f) and ends at stage (i). Stage (j) is the safety measure to be observed after the completion of the cycles in order to prevent gasping, breathlessness and strain on the heart.

Do 8 to 10 cycles at a stretch as described above. This may take 6 or 8 minutes.

Inhalation and exhalation from each side should take the same time. In the beginning the duration will be unequal. Persevere until equality is achieved.

After achieving mastery over the equal duration and precision over inhalation and exhalation on either side an attempt may be made to retain breath (antara kumbhaka) after inhaling.

This precision is only achieved after long practice.

Retention should not disturb the rhythm and equality of inhalation and exhalation. If either are disturbed curtail the period of retention or hold the breath on alternate cycles.

During retention after inhalation practise Mūla Bandha (see p. 366).

Do not attempt to hold the breath after exhalation (bāhya kumbhaka, Image 600) until you have mastered retention after inhalation (antara kumbhaka). Then during bāhya kumbhaka practise Uddiyana (Images 593, 594) with Mūla Bandha (see p. 366).

Retention and the lengthening of inhalation and exhalation should only be attempted with the help and under the guidance of an experienced Guru.

Always conclude by lying down in Savasana. (Image 592)

BH_IV,Bhastrika Pranayama,Bhasrīkā Prāṇāyāma,,-,,,,377,"206 / Bhastrikā Prānāyāma
The technique is given in two stages here.

Technique: Stage I

Follow the technique in paras 1 and 2 of Ujjayi.

Take a fast, vigorous breath and exhale fast and forcefully. One inhalation and one exhalation completes a cycle of Bhastrikā. The sound made resembles air rushing through bellows.

Complete at a stretch 10 to 12 cycles. Then take a slow deep breath as in Ujjayi. Retain the breath with Mūla Bandha for 2 to 3 seconds, then exhale slowly and deeply as in Ujjayi.

This Ujjayi type of breathing rests the lungs and the diaphragm and prepares them for fresh cycles of Bhastrikā.

Repeat the cycles of Bhastrikā three to four times with Ujjayi breathing in between.

If the sound of the air lessens, and the vigour diminishes, then reduce their number.

After completion lie down in Savasana. (Image 592)

Technique: Stage II

Follow the technique in paras 1 and 2 of Ujjayi.

Adjust the thumb and finger pressure on the nostrils as explained in the technique of Sūrya Bhedana.

Close the left nostril completely but keep the right nostril partially open.

Inhale and exhale vigorously only through the right nostril for 10 to 12 cycles of Bhastrikā as in Stage I above.

Close the right nostril. Open the left nostril partially and repeat Bhastrikā for an equal number of cycles.

Release the fingers from the nostrils.

Take a few deep breaths as in Ujjayi.

Repeat the cycles on both sides three or four times, doing Ujjayi in between.

After completion lie down in Savasana. (Image 592)","1. In stage III one cycle of bhastrika blasts is done through the right nostril, the other from the left. 2. In this stage, the in and out blasts are done through alternate nostrils; that is, if the in-breath is done from the right, then the out-breath is from the left and then the other way round. 3. Four or five such blasts form one half-cycle. 4. The other one starts with an in-breath from the left and is followed by an out-breath from the right, with an equal number of blasts. 5. These two make one cycle of Stage IV. 6. Sit in any comfortable position, following the techniques given in Paras of ujjayi, Stage V. 7. Exhale whatever breath is in the lungs. 8. Bring the right hand to the nostrils as explained in Paras 12 to 22 in Ch. 22 on digital pranayama. 9. Block the left nostril, half-open the right and take a quick strong in-breath through it. 10. Quickly close the right nostril, half-open the left and breathe out quickly and vigorously through it. 11. Do four or five blasts in quick succession. This forms the first half-cycle. 12. Now do the other half-cycle, repeating the same procedure as above, but breathing in from the left and out through the right. 13. This completes the second half-cycle. Do an equal number of blasts as above, maintaining the same rhythm, tone, and volume throughout. 14. Do three to four such full cycles, take a few breaths of ujjayi to rest the lungs, and then rest in savasana.",,,Stage IV
207,Kapalabhati Pranayama,Kapālabhāti Prānāyāma,,-,,,,378,"207. Kapālabhāti Prānāyāma
The process or kriya of Kapālabhāti (kapāla = skull; bhāti = light, lustre) is a milder form of Bhastrikā Prānāyāma. In Kapālabhāti, the inhalation is slow but the exhalation is vigorous. There is a split second of retention after each exhalation.

Do a few cycles of Kapālabhāti instead of Bhastrikā if the latter breathing proves too strenuous. Lie down in Savasana after finishing Kapālabhāti. (Image 592)

Effects Both Bhastrikā and Kapālabhāti activate and invigorate the liver, spleen, pancreas and abdominal muscles. Thus digestion is improved, the sinuses are drained, the eyes feel cool and one has a general sense of exhilaration.

Caution

As a locomotive engine is stoked with coal to generate steam to pull the train, so Bhastrikā generates prāna to activate the entire body. Too much stoking burns out the boiler of the engine. So also too long a practice of Bhastrikā wears out the system as the breathing process is forceful.

Persons with a weak constitution and poor lung capacity should not attempt Bhastrikā or Kapālabhāti.

Those suffering from ear or eye complaints (pus in the ear, detachment of the retina or glaucoma) should not attempt them either.

Nor should persons with high or low blood pressure.

If the nose starts to bleed or the ears to throb and ache, immediately stop Bhastrikā or Kapālabhāti.

Do not practise either for some time.","Kapalabhati, sometimes referred to as a pranayama or a kriya, involves slow inhalation and vigorous exhalation. The term 'kapala' means skull and 'bhati' means light or luster. This technique is similar to bhastrika but milder. It includes a split second of retention after each exhalation. Kapalabhati can be divided into stages similar to bhastrika and practiced accordingly.",Do kapalabhati instead of bhastrika if the latter proves too strenuous.,"Kapalabhati is similar to bhastrika but milder.

Technique

Sit in any comfortable position like Padmasana (Image 104), Siddhasana (Image 84) or Virasana (Image 89).

Keep the back erect and rigid. Lower the head to the trunk. Rest the chin in the notch between the collar-bones just above the breast-bone. (This is the Jalandhara Bandha.)

Stretch the arms out straight and rest the back of the wrists on the knees. Join the tips of the index fingers to the tips of the thumbs, keeping the other fingers extended. (This position or gesture of the hand is known as the Jñāna Mudra, the symbol or seal of knowledge. The index finger symbolises the individual soul and the thumb the Universal Soul. The union of the two symbolises knowledge.)

Close the eyes and look inwards. (Image 597)

Exhale completely.

Inhalation (Pūraka): Take a slow, deep steady breath through both nostrils. The passage of the incoming air is felt on the roof of the palate and makes a sibilant sound (sa). This sound should be heard. Fill the lungs up to the brim. Care should be taken not to bloat the abdomen in the process of inhalation.

The entire abdominal area from the pubes up to the breast-bone should be pulled back towards the spine.

Retention (Antara Kumbhaka): Hold the breath for a second or two. Observe Mūla Bandha as described on p. 366.

Exhalation (Rechaka): Exhale slowly, deeply and steadily, until the lungs are completely empty. As you begin to exhale, keep your grip on the abdomen. After two or three seconds of exhalation, relax the diaphragm gradually and slowly.

Note: Unlike standard Ujjayi, during this exhalation, a soft humming sound like the murmuring of bees is made.

Wait (Bāhya Kumbhaka): Wait for a second before drawing a fresh breath.

Repeat the cycles for 5 to 10 minutes keeping the eyes closed throughout.

Sama means the same or identical, straight, entire, whole and complete: also similarly or in the same manner.

Vrtti means action, movement, function or operation, a course of conduct or method.

In Sama Vrtti Pranayama, therefore, an attempt is made to achieve uniformity in the duration of all the three processes of breathing, namely, puraka or inhalation, kumbhaka or retention, and rechaka or exhalation in any type of pranayama. If one lasts 5 seconds so do the others.

This uniformity of 5 seconds should be maintained throughout all cycles of breathing in any type of Pranayama like Ujjayi, Surya Bhedana, Nadi Sodhana, Sitali and so on.

Caution 5. In the beginning Sama Vrtti Pranayama should be confined only to inhalation (puraka) and exhalation (rechaka). 6. First, achieve uniformity of length of time in puraka and rechaka then only attempt antara kumbhaka (retention of breath after full inhalation). 7. Start the antara kumbhaka gradually. In the beginning, the ratio time for puraka, antara kumbhaka and rechaka should be kept at 1 : 1/2 : 1. 8. Very slowly increase the proportions to 1 : 3/4 : 1. After this is firmly established attempt 1 : 1 : 1. Only after mastering this, increase the proportion of antara kumbhaka so as to achieve the ratio of 1 : 1 : 1. 9. Do not attempt bahya kumbhaka (restraint of breath after full exhalation) until you have achieved the desired ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 in puraka, antara kumbhaka and rechaka. 10. If all air is expelled from the lungs, the vacuum inside and the atmospheric pressure outside will create a tremendous strain upon the lungs. Therefore, in the beginning, do not do both antara kumbhaka and bahya kumbhaka together. 11. Practise antara kumbhaka and bahya kumbhaka separately or alternately. It is beneficial to practise kumbhakas first by interspersing them after two or three cycles of deep breathing with puraka and rechaka alone. For example do two or three cycles of deep breathing and one cycle of antara kumbhaka. Then do two or three cycles of deep breathing followed by one cycle of bahya kumbhaka. Start with 3 antara kumbhakas and 3 bahya kumbhakas, and increase the number of kumbhakas very gradually.
In Sama Vrtti Pranayama, therefore, an attempt is made to achieve uniformity in the duration of all the three processes of breathing, namely, puraka or inhalation, kumbhaka or retention, and rechaka or exhalation in any type of pranayama. If one lasts 5 seconds so do the others.

212,Visama Vrtti Pranayama,Viṣama Vṛtti Prāṇāyāma,,-,,,,381,"212 / Visama Vrtti Pranayama
Visama means among many other things irregular and difficult.

Visama Vrtti Pranayama is so called because the same length of time for inhalation, retention and exhalation is not maintained. This leads to interruption of rhythm and the difference in ratio creates difficulty and danger for the pupil.

In this type of pranayama if full inhalation takes 5 seconds, the breath is held (antara kumbhaka) for 20 seconds, and exhalation takes 10 seconds, the ratio being 1 : 4 : 2. At first the pupil will find it hard to maintain the rhythm during exhalation, but it all eases with practice.

Conversely, if inhalation is for 10 seconds, the breath is held for 20 seconds and exhalation takes 5 seconds, the ratio here being 2 : 4 : 1.

Again if the length of time can be so varied that if inhalation is for 20 seconds, retention is for 10 seconds and the exhalation for 5, the ratio being 4 : 2 : 1.

In one cycle of pranayama, one can adopt the ratios 1 : 2 : 4, 2 : 4 : 1, and 4 : 1 : 2. Then these three ratios are counted as one cycle of pranayama.

If bahya kumbhaka (restraint after full exhalation and before fresh inhalation) is also observed, the combination of ratios will be greater still.

If the different ratios are observed in the Viloma, Anuloma and Pratiloma methods of pranayama (described below) in the basic varieties of pranayamas like Ujjayi, Surya Bhedana, Nadi Sodhana, Bhramari, Sitali and Sitakari, the number of combinations will be astronomical.

No mortal could perform all these different combinations in one lifetime.

The path of Visama Vrtti Pranayama is fraught with danger. Do not, therefore, dream of attempting to practise it on your own without the personal supervision of an experienced Guru or teacher.

Due to disharmony caused by these different time ratios for inhalation, retention and exhalation, all the systems of the body, especially the respiratory and nervous ones, are overtaxed and unduly strained.

The caution given on Sama Vrtti Pranayama (see p. 381), regarding the practice of kumbhaka in paragraphs 5 to 10, applies with greater force in Visama Vrtti Pranayama.

One now begins to realise the truth of Svatmarama’s statement in the second chapter of the Hatha Yoga Pradipika: ‘Prana should be tamed more slowly and more gradually than lions, elephants and tigers (according to one’s capacities and physical limitations); otherwise it will kill the practitioner.’

Sahita means accompanied by, together with or associated with. When pranayama practices are observed with the intentional aid and deliberate accompaniment of bahya and antara kumbhaka, they are known as Sahita Kumbhaka Pranayamas.

Kevala means isolated, pure, absolute and perfect. When the practices of kumbhaka becomes instinctive, they are called Kevala Kumbhaka.

When the pupil has mastered Kevala Kumbhaka, he has isolated himself from the world and is in tune with the Infinite. He has obtained a measure of control over one of the most subtle and powerful of elements which can pervade the smallest crevice as well as the vast sky. His mind is completely absorbed with Prana and becomes as free as Prana itself.

As a wind drives smoke and impurities from the atmosphere, pranayama drives away the impurities of the body and the mind. Then, says Patanjali, the DIVINE FIRE within blazes forth in its full glory and the mind becomes fit for concentration (dharana) and meditation (dhyana). (Yoga Sutras, chapter II, 52 and 53.) This takes a long time. By degrees is the darkness banished by the dawn.

1. Sit in a comfortable position like siddhasana, swastikasana, bhadrasana, virasana, baddhakonasana or padmasana (see Pls 10-14). 2. Keep the back erect. 3. Lift the sternum and the front part of the rib cage. 4. Without tensing, stretch the sides of the neck and move the shoulder blades into the body; keep the thoracic and cervical spine concave and bend the head forwards and downwards from the back of the neck towards the chest. Do not constrict the throat or strain the neck muscles. It should not be forced forward, downward or tensed back (Pls 55 and 56). 5. Keep the neck and throat muscles soft. 6. Bring the head down so that the point and both sides of the jaw-bone rest evenly in the notch between the collar-bones on the front wall of the chest (Pls 57 and 58). 7. Do not stretch the chin more to one side or the other (Pl. 59). 8. Also do not tilt the neck to one side (Pl. 60), which may cause pain and strain that continue for a long time. 9. As elasticity is gained, the neck bends down increasingly. 10. Do not force the chin to the chest as in Pl. 55, but lift the chest to meet the descending chin as in Pl. 58. 11. Keep the centre of the head and chin in alignment with the middle of the sternum, the navel and the perineum (Pl. 61). 12. Do not cave in the ribs, while resting the chin on the chest (Pl. 62). 13. Relax the temples and keep the eyes and ears passive (Pl. 57).

Do not constrict the lungs while the abdominal organs are compressed.
Do not squeeze the abdomen until the breath has been expelled.
If strain is felt on the temples or if the intake of breath is labored, this means that the uddiyana has been done beyond capacity.
Practice on an empty stomach only.
Never inhale until the grip of uddiyana is released and the abdominal organs are brought to their original relaxed state.

It is said to be the lion that kills the elephant named death.
It is the best of bandhas, and he who constantly practices it, as taught by his guru, becomes young again.
It exercises the diaphragm.
Through uddiyana bandha the great bird prana is forced to fly up through the sushumna nadi, the main channel for the flow of nervous energy, which is situated inside the spinal column (merudanda).

218,Mula Bandha,Mūla Bandha,,,,,,,"218 / Mula Bandha
### Stage I
1. Contract the muscles of the area between the anus and the genitals and lift them vertically towards the navel. 2. Simultaneously, press the lower anterior abdomen below the navel backwards and upwards towards the spine. 3. Change the downward course of apana vayu and make it flow up to unite with the prana vayu, which has its seat in the region of the chest. 4. Attempt mula bandha first in internal retention after inhalation (antarakumbhaka). 5. In mula bandha, only the perineal and lower abdominal area between the anus and navel is contracted, pulled back to the spine, and lifted up towards the diaphragm (PL 69). 6. Practice contracting the anal sphincter muscles (asvini mudra) to help master mula bandha.

Even the correct performance of mula bandha has its own dangers as it increases sexual retentive power, which the practitioner is tempted to abuse.
Improper performance of the former will cause involuntary discharge of semen and loss of vitality.
Improper performance of the latter will seriously weaken the practitioner, who will lack virility.
There is grave danger in attempting to learn the uddiyana and mula bandhas by oneself.

The lift of the diaphragm gently massages the muscles of the heart, thereby toning them.
It tones the abdominal organs, increases the gastric fire, and eliminates toxins in the digestive tract.
The practitioner acquires moral and spiritual power, which will shine forth like the sun.
With the mastery of the three bandhas, the yogi is at the crossroads of his destiny, one road leading to bhoga (the enjoyment of worldly pleasures) and the other to Yoga, union with the Supreme Soul.
The goal is the complete restraint or bandha of the chitta, which includes the mind (manas), the intellect (buddhi), and the ego (ahamkara).
While practicing mula bandha, the yogi attempts to reach the true source (mula) of all creation.
The yogi's senses are turned inwards to meet the Source of all Creation.",,,,

D_I,Dhyana,Dhyāna,,,,,,,"220 / Dhyana
1. Dhyana means absorption. h is the an of self-study, reflection, keen
observation, or the search for the Infinite within. It is the observaiion ofche
physical processes of che body, study of mental states and profound
contemplation. It means looking inwards to one's innermost being. Dhyana
is the discovery of the Self.
z. When the powers of the intellect and the heart are harmoniously
blended, this 1s dhyana. All creativity proceeds from it, and ,cs good and
beautiful resulls benefit mankind.
3. Dhyana 1s hke deep sleep, but with a difference. The serenity of deep
sleep comes as a result of unconsciously forgeuing one's ldenuty and
individuality, whereas meditation brings serenity which is alert and
conscious chroughout. The sadhaka remains a witness (saksl) co all
activities. Chronological and psychological time have no existence in deep
sleep or in total absorption. In sleep the body and mind recover from wear
and tear and feel fresh upon waking. In meditation the sadhaka experiences
illuminat,on.
4. Dhyana is the full integration of the contemplator, the act of contemp•
lation and the object contemplated upon. becoming one. The distinction
between the knower, the instrument of knowledge and the object known
vanishes. The sadhaka becomes vibrant, alert and poised. He becomes free
from hunger, thirst, sleep and sex as well as from desire, anger, greed,
infaruation, pride and envy. He is unassailable by the dualities of body and
mind, or mind and self. His vmon reflects his true self like a well-polished
mirror. This 1s Atma-Oarsana, the reflection of the Soul.
5. Jesus said that man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that
proceeds out of the mouth of God. Pondering upon the meaning oflife, man
1s convinced that there dwells within his soul a force or light far greater than
himself. Yet in his walk of life he is beset by many cares and doubcs. Being
caught in 1he environment of artificial civilisation he develops a false sense
of values. H,s words and acuons run counter to his thoughts. He 1s
bewildered by these concradiccions. He realises that life is full of oppos11espain
and pleasure, sorrow and joy, conflict and peace. Seeing these
224 Light on Pra'!IJ.ylJ.ma
p0lanucs, he strives 10 auain a balance lxtween them and 10 find a stale of
stab1l11y so that he can experience freedom from pain, sorrow and conflict.
In his search he discovers the three noble ways of word (ji\ana), work
(karma) and worship (bhaku), which u,ach him that his inner light is the
only guide leading to mastery over his own life. To reach this inner light he
turns 10 mcditauon or dyhana.
6. To have a clear nouon of the true natures of man, of the world and of
God, the sildhaka should study the sacred books (Sas eras). Then he can disunguish
the real from the unreal. Knowledge of these three truths (tat1va
traya) - the soul (chit), the wurld (achit) and God (isvara) - is essential
for him who seeks libcrauon. Such knowledge gives him insight into life's
problems and 1he1r soluuon, and strengthens his spiritual sadbana. Yet
knowledge acquired by reading alone w,ll not lead 10 hberation. It 1s by
having courage and unshakable faith in the teachings contained in the
sacred books and by pumng 1hem 1nro practice 1111 they become a part of his
daily life that the sadhaka gains freedom from the domma1ion of his senses.
Knowledge of 1he sacred books and sadhana are the two wings by which the
sadhaka flies towards liberation.
7. Man is drawn between two paths. one drags h,m downwards 10wards
fulfilment of voluptuous desires and sense gratifications, leading 10
bondage and destruction; che other guides htm upwards towards purity and
realisation of his inner Self. Desires fog his mind and veil his true Self. Jc is
1he mind alone which leads 10 bondage or to liberation. It is his reason or
intelligence which either controls h,s mind or allows itself to be dominated.
8. An untrained mind flies aimlessly in all directions. The practice of
meditation brings 11 to a state of stability and then direccs it to proceed from
imperfect knowledge to perfection. The sadhaka's mind and imelhgence
work as an integrated team led by his w,11-power. He finds harmony
between his thoughts, speech and actions. His stilled mind and intelligence
burn hke a lamp m a windless place with simphcity, innocence and
illumination.
9. Man has great potentialities that lie dormant within him. His body and
mind arc like fallow land lying untilled and unsown. A wise farmer ploughs
his land (ksetra), provides i1 with water and fertiliser, plants the best seeds,
carefully tends the crops and ultimately reaps a good harvest. To the
sAdhaka, his own body, mind and intellect are the field which he ploughs
with energy and right action. He sows with the finest seeds of knowledge,
waters It with devouon and tends them w11h unrelenting spiritual discipline
to reap 1he harvest of harmony and peace. He then becomes 1he wise owner
(ksetr•ma) of his field, and his body becomes a sacred place. The
,
Dhy/Jna ( M,di1a1ion) 225
germination of the seeds of good thoughts (savichara), planted by sound
logic (savitarka), brings clarity 10 his mind and wisdom 10 his in1ellec1
(sasmita). He becomes an abode of joy (ananda) as his whole being is filled
with the Lord.
10. The journey to the moon and outer space demanded years of rigorous
uaining and discipline, deep study, research and preparation. The inward
journey of man to reach his inner Self demands the same type of relentless
effon. Years of discipline and long unincerrupted practice of 1he moral and
ethical principles of yama and niyama, training of 1he body by asanas and
pranayAma, restrainc of the senses by pratyahara and dharana, ensure the
growth of the mind and of inner awareness - dhyana and samadhi.
11. Dhara,;ui (derived from the root dhr, meaning to hold, or concentration)
is like a lamp which is covered and does not light up the area outside.
When the covet is removed, the lamp lights up the whole area. Th,~ is
dhyana, which is the expansion of consciousness. Then the sadhaka
acquires a unified mind and maintains a dynamic unfading awareness in its
pristine purity. Like oil in seeds and fragrance in flowers, the soul of man
permeates his whole body.
12. The lotus 1s symbolic of meditation. It symbolises punry. Its qu1e1
beauty has given it a prime place in Indian religious thought. It 1s
connected with most of the Hindu deities and their seats m the chakras. The
stage of meditation ,s like 1ha1 of a lorus bud hiding its inner beauty while
awaiting 1ransforma1ion imo a full blown lotus. As the bud opens to reveal
its resplendent beauty, so also the sadhaka's ,nner light is transformed and
transfigured by med11ation. He becomes an enlightened soul (siddha) and
an inspired sage. He ltves in the eternal now - the present, without yester•
days and tomorrows.
13. This state of 1he sadhaka is one of passivj1y known as manolaya (manas
meaning mind, and laya, meaning absorption or merging). He has fully
marshalled his intelligence (prajiia) and energy (prai;ia) to prevent the
intrusion of external thoughts. His s1a1e is full of dynamic alertness. When
both the internal and external thoughts are stilled and silenced, there is no
waste of physical, mental or intellectual energy.
14. Dhyana is a sub1ective experience of an objective state. It is difficult to
describe the experience in words, for words are inadequate to do so, The
delight experienced a1 the first bite of a delicious mango is indescribable. So
it is with meditation. In meditation there is no seeking or searching, as
1hc soul and goal have become one. The nectar of infinity must be tasted,
the abundant grace of the Lord within must be experienced. Then the
226 Light on Prlln4yllma
individual soul (iivatmi) becomes one with the Universal Soul (Paramatma).
The sadbaka experiences the fullness sung by the Upanisads: That
is full; this is full. Fullness comes out of fullness. Even after fullness is
taken from the full, fullness yet remains.","1. Meditation is the technique of inter-penetrating the five sheaths (kosas) of the Sadhaka to blend them into one harmonious whole. 2. The body is known as the city of Brahma (Brahmapuri) with nine gates. These gates are the eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, anus, and the reproductive organ. Some add the navel and the crown of the head and say that the body has eleven gates. All these have to be closed in meditation. The city is controlled by the ten winds (vayus), five organs of perception (jnanendriyas), five organs of action (karmendriyas), and seven chakras or inner chambers. As pearls are strung together on a thread to make a necklace, so have the chakras to be connected to the self to make an integrated person. 3. In meditation, the brain has to be well balanced in relation to the spine. Any unevenness in its position disturbs the quietness of meditation. The energies of the left and the right hemispheres of the brain have to be brought to the center. The thinking activity of the brain ceases. Just as one withdraws energy from a particular limb or part of the body to make it passive, so also the flow of energy to the brain must be reduced and directed towards the heart - the seat of the soul. The key to the technique of meditation lies in keeping the brain as a passive observer.",Ensure the body does not collapse during meditation to avoid intellectual dullness and a distracted mind.,"Meditation leads to the integration of body, mind, intelligence, will, consciousness, ego, and the self. It allows the practitioner to experience universality, timelessness, and fullness.",Stage I

taken from the full, fullness yet remains.","4. The various preparatory techniques of yama, niyama, asana, and pranayama mold the body and mind, pacify and balance them. In a steady and stable posture, free from physical and mental disturbances, an even circulation of arterial and venous blood, lymphatic and cerebro-spinal fluid is maintained through the head and spinal column. Stimulation is kept minimal and as symmetrical as possible. This evenness of circulation and stimulation allows the brain and mind to attain a unification of knowledge and experience. 5. The brain is divided into three main portions: the cerebral cortex, the hypothalamus, and the cerebellum. The cerebral cortex functions in the process of thinking, speech, memory, and imagination. The hypothalamus regulates the activities of the internal organs and imprints emotional reactions of pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow, contentment and disappointment. The cerebellum is the center of muscular coordination. The back brain is regarded as that which functions in meditation; it is the seat of wisdom and clarity.",Ensure the body does not collapse during meditation to avoid intellectual dullness and a distracted mind.,"Meditation leads to the integration of body, mind, intelligence, will, consciousness, ego, and the self.

1. Dhyana means absorption. h is the an of self-study, reflection, keen
observation, or the search for the Infinite within. It is the observaiion ofche
physical processes of che body, study of mental states and profound
contemplation. It means looking inwards to one's innermost being. Dhyana
is the discovery of the Self.
z. When the powers of the intellect and the heart are harmoniously
blended, this 1s dhyana. All creativity proceeds from it, and ,cs good and
beautiful resulls benefit mankind.
3. Dhyana 1s hke deep sleep, but with a difference. The serenity of deep
sleep comes as a result of unconsciously forgeuing one's ldenuty and
individuality, whereas meditation brings serenity which is alert and
conscious chroughout. The sadhaka remains a witness (saksl) co all
activities. Chronological and psychological time have no existence in deep
sleep or in total absorption. In sleep the body and mind recover from wear
and tear and feel fresh upon waking. In meditation the sadhaka experiences
illuminat,on.
4. Dhyana is the full integration of the contemplator, the act of contemp•
lation and the object contemplated upon. becoming one. The distinction
between the knower, the instrument of knowledge and the object known
vanishes. The sadhaka becomes vibrant, alert and poised. He becomes free
from hunger, thirst, sleep and sex as well as from desire, anger, greed,
infaruation, pride and envy. He is unassailable by the dualities of body and
mind, or mind and self. His vmon reflects his true self like a well-polished
mirror. This 1s Atma-Oarsana, the reflection of the Soul.
5. Jesus said that man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that
proceeds out of the mouth of God. Pondering upon the meaning oflife, man
1s convinced that there dwells within his soul a force or light far greater than
himself. Yet in his walk of life he is beset by many cares and doubcs. Being
caught in 1he environment of artificial civilisation he develops a false sense
of values. H,s words and acuons run counter to his thoughts. He 1s
bewildered by these concradiccions. He realises that life is full of oppos11espain
and pleasure, sorrow and joy, conflict and peace. Seeing these
224 Light on Pra'!IJ.ylJ.ma
p0lanucs, he strives 10 auain a balance lxtween them and 10 find a stale of
stab1l11y so that he can experience freedom from pain, sorrow and conflict.
In his search he discovers the three noble ways of word (ji\ana), work
(karma) and worship (bhaku), which u,ach him that his inner light is the
only guide leading to mastery over his own life. To reach this inner light he
turns 10 mcditauon or dyhana.
6. To have a clear nouon of the true natures of man, of the world and of
God, the sildhaka should study the sacred books (Sas eras). Then he can disunguish
the real from the unreal. Knowledge of these three truths (tat1va
traya) - the soul (chit), the wurld (achit) and God (isvara) - is essential
for him who seeks libcrauon. Such knowledge gives him insight into life's
problems and 1he1r soluuon, and strengthens his spiritual sadbana. Yet
knowledge acquired by reading alone w,ll not lead 10 hberation. It 1s by
having courage and unshakable faith in the teachings contained in the
sacred books and by pumng 1hem 1nro practice 1111 they become a part of his
daily life that the sadhaka gains freedom from the domma1ion of his senses.
Knowledge of 1he sacred books and sadhana are the two wings by which the
sadhaka flies towards liberation.
7. Man is drawn between two paths. one drags h,m downwards 10wards
fulfilment of voluptuous desires and sense gratifications, leading 10
bondage and destruction; che other guides htm upwards towards purity and
realisation of his inner Self. Desires fog his mind and veil his true Self. Jc is
1he mind alone which leads 10 bondage or to liberation. It is his reason or
intelligence which either controls h,s mind or allows itself to be dominated.
8. An untrained mind flies aimlessly in all directions. The practice of
meditation brings 11 to a state of stability and then direccs it to proceed from
imperfect knowledge to perfection. The sadhaka's mind and imelhgence
work as an integrated team led by his w,11-power. He finds harmony
between his thoughts, speech and actions. His stilled mind and intelligence
burn hke a lamp m a windless place with simphcity, innocence and
illumination.
9. Man has great potentialities that lie dormant within him. His body and
mind arc like fallow land lying untilled and unsown. A wise farmer ploughs
his land (ksetra), provides i1 with water and fertiliser, plants the best seeds,
carefully tends the crops and ultimately reaps a good harvest. To the
sAdhaka, his own body, mind and intellect are the field which he ploughs
with energy and right action. He sows with the finest seeds of knowledge,
waters It with devouon and tends them w11h unrelenting spiritual discipline
to reap 1he harvest of harmony and peace. He then becomes 1he wise owner
(ksetr•ma) of his field, and his body becomes a sacred place. The
,
Dhy/Jna ( M,di1a1ion) 225
germination of the seeds of good thoughts (savichara), planted by sound
logic (savitarka), brings clarity 10 his mind and wisdom 10 his in1ellec1
(sasmita). He becomes an abode of joy (ananda) as his whole being is filled
with the Lord.
10. The journey to the moon and outer space demanded years of rigorous
uaining and discipline, deep study, research and preparation. The inward
journey of man to reach his inner Self demands the same type of relentless
effon. Years of discipline and long unincerrupted practice of 1he moral and
ethical principles of yama and niyama, training of 1he body by asanas and
pranayAma, restrainc of the senses by pratyahara and dharana, ensure the
growth of the mind and of inner awareness - dhyana and samadhi.
11. Dhara,;ui (derived from the root dhr, meaning to hold, or concentration)
is like a lamp which is covered and does not light up the area outside.
When the covet is removed, the lamp lights up the whole area. Th,~ is
dhyana, which is the expansion of consciousness. Then the sadhaka
acquires a unified mind and maintains a dynamic unfading awareness in its
pristine purity. Like oil in seeds and fragrance in flowers, the soul of man
permeates his whole body.
12. The lotus 1s symbolic of meditation. It symbolises punry. Its qu1e1
beauty has given it a prime place in Indian religious thought. It 1s
connected with most of the Hindu deities and their seats m the chakras. The
stage of meditation ,s like 1ha1 of a lorus bud hiding its inner beauty while
awaiting 1ransforma1ion imo a full blown lotus. As the bud opens to reveal
its resplendent beauty, so also the sadhaka's ,nner light is transformed and
transfigured by med11ation. He becomes an enlightened soul (siddha) and
an inspired sage. He ltves in the eternal now - the present, without yester•
days and tomorrows.
13. This state of 1he sadhaka is one of passivj1y known as manolaya (manas
meaning mind, and laya, meaning absorption or merging). He has fully
marshalled his intelligence (prajiia) and energy (prai;ia) to prevent the
intrusion of external thoughts. His s1a1e is full of dynamic alertness. When
both the internal and external thoughts are stilled and silenced, there is no
waste of physical, mental or intellectual energy.
14. Dhyana is a sub1ective experience of an objective state. It is difficult to
describe the experience in words, for words are inadequate to do so, The

Any comfortable position may be assumed for sitting, though padmasana is ideal. Alignment of the Body: 8. Without performing the jalandhara bandha, follow correctly the instructions given in the chapter on the Art of Sitting. 9. Raise the front and back portions of the body evenly, attentively, and rhythmically, without jerking. 10. Keep the spine erect and the chest lifted up. This slows down the flow of breath, lessens the activity of the brain, and leads to the cessation of all thoughts. 11. Keep the body alert, with razor-sharp awareness. Keep the brain passive, sensitive, and silent, like the thin end of a leaf, which shakes even in a gentle breeze. 12. Collapse of the body brings intellectual dullness and a distracted mind disturbs the steadiness of the body. Avoid both.",Ensure the body does not collapse during meditation to avoid intellectual dullness and a distracted mind.,"Meditation leads to the integration of body, mind, intelligence, will, consciousness, ego, and the self.

When the mind oscillates, press the palms to bring back the attention of the mind on the Self. If the pressure of the palms becomes loose, it is a sign that the mind is wandering. Again join them firmly to recollect the Self. 18. Dhyana is the integration of the body, mind, intelligence, will, consciousness, ego, and the self. The body is the external layer of the mind, mind of the intelligence, intelligence of the will, will of consciousness, consciousness of the 'I' or ego, and the 'I' of the pure Self (Atma).
