    "description": "170 / Samakonasana\nSama means the same, like, even or straight. Kona means an angle and a point of a compass. In this asana the split is performed with the legs spread apart sideways, and the hands are folded in front of the chest. It is harder to perform than Hanumanasana. (Image 475.) Both the legs and the pelvic region of the body are in one straight line.\n\nTechnique\n\nStand in Tadasana (Image 1), rest the hands on the hips and spread the legs apart sideways to your capacity. (Image 29)\n\nPlace the palms on the floor (Image 30) and with an exhalation stretch the legs further and further until you sit on the floor with both legs spread sideways in a straight line. The entire back of the legs, especially the back of the knees, should rest on the floor.\n\nJoin the palms in front of the chest (Image 477) and stay in the pose for a few seconds.\n\nPlace the palms on the floor, raise the hips and bring the legs closer and closer to each other until you stand up again in Uttanasana. (Image 47.) Then stand in Tadasana (Image 1) and relax.\n\nEffects: In this pose the hip joints are exercised and the legs are made to move freely in all directions. The spine is stretched and any defect in the lower part of the spine is cured. The pose, like Hanumanasana (Image 475), tones the leg muscles and makes the legs shapely. It prevents the development of hernia and relieves sciatic pains. It helps the blood to circulate in the pelvic region and genital organs and keeps them healthy.",
    "technique": "Be seated on the yoga mat. Keep your legs straight and extended in front of you. Slowly inhale and lengthen your spine. Keep your head to buttocks in one line. Engage your core. As you exhale, split your legs wide apart. Exhale and bend forward from your hips slowly. Lower your upper body until it is parallel to the ground. Keep your legs straight with a very slight bend at the knees. Do not hunch your back. Keep your spine straight. Gaze forward.",

Align the heels, knees, crotch, coccyx, spinal column, and the base of the skull on the straight line. Adjust the front of the body so the bridge of the nose, chin, sternum, navel, and pubis are in a single vertical plane. Check that the ears, outer corners of the eyes, and the jawbone are parallel to the floor. Stretch the back of the neck centrally and pin the inner points of the shoulder blades to the floor. Roll the skin of the upper chest from the collarbones toward the shoulder blades to broaden the chest. Rest the center of the sacrum on the floor to allow the buttocks to relax evenly. Let the feet fall outwards evenly so the big toes feel weightless. Place the hands fifteen to twenty degrees away from the body with the palms facing upwards. Bend the arms at the elbows to touch the shoulder tops before extending the triceps toward the feet. Lower the forearms and extend the hands from the wrists to the knuckles with passive fingers. Relax the muscles of the back from the trunk to the neck and the front of the body from the pubis to the throat. Close the eyelids gently and move the upper lids toward the inner corners of the eyes. Release any tightness in the forehead by slightly raising the eyebrows. Keep the root of the tongue passive and resting on the lower palate. Soften the skin of the temples, cheekbones, and the lower jaw to quieten the brain. Exhale softly and deeply while ensuring the breath flows evenly through both nostrils. Keep the head straight and parallel to the ceiling to remain anchored in the present moment. Observe the internal silence and keep the senses of knowledge passive and receptive. Maintain this state of complete physical and mental stillness for ten to fifteen minutes. Remain as a silent observer until normal activity returns to the brain. Open the eyes slowly and gently without focusing them immediately. Bend the knees and turn the head and body to one side. Stay in this side lying position for one or two minutes before repeating on the other side. Rise slowly to a seated position to avoid strain or heaviness in the head.",

Grip the middle of the thighs firmly with the hands. Bend the arms slightly at the elbows. Lower the chin as far down as possible to form the chin lock (Jalandhara Bandha). Inhale deeply through the nose. Exhale quickly so the air is expelled from the lungs in a single rush. Hold the breath without allowing any inhalation. Pull the whole abdominal region back towards the spine. Lift the abdominal muscles upwards toward the diaphragm. Keep the chest broad without hollowing it. Raise the lumbar and dorsal spine forwards and upwards. Squeeze the abdominal organs towards the back of the body. Press the organs firmly against the spine. Lift the hands from the thighs while maintaining the abdominal grip. Rest the hands higher on the pelvic rim. Press the hands into the pelvic rim to create a firmer contraction. Straighten the back while keeping the abdominal grip tight. Keep the chin lowered in the chin lock (Jalandhara Bandha). Hold the grip for ten to fifteen seconds. Avoid holding the breath beyond the limit of endurance. Relax the abdominal muscles first without moving the chin or the head. Allow the abdomen to return to its normal relaxed position. Inhale slowly and quietly. Refrain from any inhalation during the contraction and holding phases. Take a few normal breaths to recover. Repeat the entire cycle not more than six to eight times at a single stretch. Practice this sequence once a day only. Master this standing technique before introducing the abdominal lock (Uddiyana Bandha) into seated pranayama during the interval after exhalation.",

Keep the back erect and rigid. Lower the head to the trunk. Rest the chin in the notch between the collar-bones just above the breast-bone. (This is Jalandhara Bandha.)\n\n3. Stretch the left arm. Rest the back of the left wrist on the left knee. Perform Jñāna Mudra with the left hand (as stated in stage 3 of the technique of Ujjayi).\n\n4. Bend the right arm at the elbow. Bend the index and middle fingers towards the palm, keeping them passive. Bring the ring and little fingers towards the thumb. (Image 598)\n\n5. Place the right thumb on the right side of the nose just below the nasal bone, the ring and little fingers on the left side of the nose just below the nasal bone, just above the curve of the fatty tissue of the nostrils above the upper jaw.\n\n6. Press the ring and the little finger to block the left side of the nose completely.\n\n7. With the right thumb, press the fatty tissue on the right side so as to make the outer edge of the right nostril parallel to the lower edge of the cartilage of the septum.\n\n8. The right thumb is bent at the top joint and the tip of the thumb is placed at a right angle to the septum. (Image 599)\n\n9. Now inhale slowly and deeply controlling the aperture of the right nostril with the tip of the thumb nearer the nail. Fill the lungs to the brim (pūraka).\n\n10. Then block the right nostril so that both are now blocked.\n\n11. Hold the breath for about 5 seconds (antara kumbhaka) while practising Mūla Bandha (see p. 366).\n\n12. Keeping the right nostril completely blocked, open the left nostril partially and exhale through it slowly and deeply (rechaka).\n\n13. During the exhalation regulate the rhythmic flow of air from the left nostril by adjusting pressure with the ring and little fingers, so that the outer edge of the left nostril is kept parallel to the septum. The pressure should be exerted from the inner sides of the tips of the fingers (away from the nails).\n\n14. This completes one cycle of Sūrya Bhedana Prānāyāma. Continue with more cycles at a stretch from 5 to 10 minutes, according to capacity.\n\n15. All the inhalations in Sūrya Bhedana are from the right nostril and all the exhalations from the left nostril.\n\n16. Throughout the process, the passage of air is felt at the tips of the fingers and the thumbs and in the nasal membranes where pressure is applied. The passage of air makes a sound similar to air escaping from a cycle tube. This sound should be maintained constant throughout by varying pressure on the nostrils.\n\n17. The eyes, temples, eyebrows and the skin on the forehead should remain completely passive and show no sign of strain.\n\n18. The mind should be absorbed completely in listening to the proper sound of the passage of air and in maintaining a proper rhythm in breathing.\n\n19. Each inhalation and exhalation should last for the same length of time.\n\n20. The inhalation and the exhalation should not be forced. An even and slow rhythm should be maintained throughout.\n\n21. Lie down in Savasana after completing pranayama. (Image 592)\n\nEffects Increases digestive power, soothes and invigorates the nerves, and cleans the sinuses. Fills lungs more slowly and fully than Ujjayi. Beneficial for persons with low blood pressure.\n\nNote: Those with high blood pressure or heart trouble should not perform breath retention (kumbhaka).",
    "technique": "Sit in a comfortable meditative posture such as the lotus pose or the hero pose. Keep the back erect and rigid. Lift the chest toward the chin. Lower the head toward the trunk.

Keep the right thumb near the right nostril. Place the right ring and little fingers on the left side of the nose. Position the fingertips just below the nasal bone and above the fatty tissue. Press the ring and little fingers to block the left nostril completely. Use the right thumb to narrow the right nasal passage. Align the outer edge of the right nostril parallel to the septum. Inhale slowly and deeply through the right nostril. Fill the lungs to their full capacity. Block the right nostril with the thumb so both sides are closed. Apply the root lock (Mula Bandha) by contracting the pelvic floor.\n\nHold the breath for five seconds. Release the root lock (Mula Bandha). Keep the right nostril blocked. Open the left nostril partially with the ring and little fingers. Exhale slowly and deeply through the left nostril. Maintain the outer edge of the left nostril parallel to the septum during the out breath. Listen to the steady sound of the air as it passes the fingertips. Keep the eyes and forehead completely passive without strain. Repeat this cycle of inhaling right and exhaling left for five to ten minutes. Finish the final cycle by exhaling through the left nostril. Lower the right hand. Raise the head from the chin lock (Jalandhara Bandha). Lie down in the corpse pose (Savasana).",

    "description": "205 / Nāḍī Śodhana Prānāyāma\n\nTechnique\n\n1. Sit in any comfortable position like Padmasana (Image 104), Siddhasana (Image 84) or Virasana (Image 89).\n\n2. Keep the back erect and rigid. Lower the head to the trunk. Rest the chin in the notch between the collar-bones just above the breast-bone. (This is Jalandhara Bandha.)\n\n3. Stretch the left arm. Rest the back of the left wrist on the left knee. Perform Jñāna Mudra with the left hand (as stated in stage 3 of the technique of Ujjayi).\n\n4. Bend the right arm at the elbow. Bend the index and middle fingers towards the palm, keeping them passive. Bring the ring and little fingers towards the thumb. (Image 598)\n\n5. Place the right thumb on the right side of the nose just below the nasal bone, the ring and little fingers on the left side of the nose just below the nasal bone, just above the curve of the fatty tissue of the nostrils above the upper jaw.\n\n6. Press the ring and the little finger to block the left side of the nose completely.\n\n7. With the right thumb, press the fatty tissue on the right side so as to make the outer edge of the right nostril parallel to the lower edge of the cartilage of the septum.\n\n8. The right thumb is bent at the top joint and the tip of the thumb is placed at a right angle to the septum. (Image 599)\n\n9. Empty the lungs completely through the right nostril. Control the aperture of the right nostril with the inner side of the right thumb, away from the nail.\n\n10. Now inhale slowly, steadily and deeply through the right nostril, controlling the aperture with the tip of the right thumb near the nail. Fill the lungs to the brim (pūraka). During this inhalation the left nostril is completely blocked by the ring and little fingers.\n\n11. After full inhalation, block the right nostril completely with the pressure of the thumb and release the pressure of the ring and little fingers on the left nostril. Readjust them on the outer edge of the left nostril and keep it parallel to the septum. Exhale slowly, steadily and deeply through the left nostril. Empty the lungs completely. The pressure should be exerted from the inner sides of the tips of the ring and little fingers (away from the nails) (rechaka).\n\n12. After full exhalation through the left nostril, change the pressure on it by adjusting the fingers. In the changed position, the tips of the ring and little fingers nearer the nails exert the pressure.\n\n13. Now inhale through the left nostril slowly, steadily and deeply, filling the lungs to the brim (pūraka).\n\n14. After full inhalation through the left nostril, block it and exhale through the right nostril, adjusting the pressure of the right thumb on the right nostril as stated in para. 2 above (rechaka).\n\n15. This completes one cycle of Nāḍī Śodhana Prānāyāma. Here the rhythm of breathing is as follows: \n\n===>a. Exhale through the right nostril. \n===>b. Inhale through the right nostril. \n===>c. Exhale through the left nostril. \n===>d. Inhale through the left nostril. \n===>e. Exhale through the right nostril. \n===>f. Inhale through the right nostril. \n===>g. Exhale through the left nostril. \n===>h. Inhale through the left nostril. \n===>i. Exhale through the right nostril. \n===>j. Inhale through the right nostril ... and so on.\n\nStage (a) above is the preparatory one. The first real Nāḍī Śodhana Prānāyāma cycle starts at stage (b) and ends at stage (e). The second cycle starts at stage (f) and ends at stage (i). Stage (j) is the safety measure to be observed after the completion of the cycles in order to prevent gasping, breathlessness and strain on the heart.\n\nDo 8 to 10 cycles at a stretch as described above. This may take 6 or 8 minutes.\n\nInhalation and exhalation from each side should take the same time. In the beginning the duration will be unequal. Persevere until equality is achieved.\n\nAfter achieving mastery over the equal duration and precision over inhalation and exhalation on either side an attempt may be made to retain breath (antara kumbhaka) after inhaling.\n\nThis precision is only achieved after long practice.\n\nRetention should not disturb the rhythm and equality of inhalation and exhalation. If either are disturbed curtail the period of retention or hold the breath on alternate cycles.\n\nDuring retention after inhalation practise Mūla Bandha (see p. 366).\n\nDo not attempt to hold the breath after exhalation (bāhya kumbhaka, Image 600) until you have mastered retention after inhalation (antara kumbhaka). Then during bāhya kumbhaka practise Uddiyana (Images 593, 594) with Mūla Bandha (see p. 366).\n\nRetention and the lengthening of inhalation and exhalation should only be attempted with the help and under the guidance of an experienced Guru.\n\nAlways conclude by lying down in Savasana. (Image 592)\n\nEffects Increases oxygen supply to the blood, refreshing the body; calms and purifies the nerves; stills and clears the mind (lucidity).\n\nNote: Persons with high blood pressure or heart trouble should not hold their breath (kumbhaka). Persons with low blood pressure benefit from internal retention.",
    "technique": "Sit in a comfortable meditative posture such as the lotus pose or the hero pose. Keep the back erect and rigid. Lift the chest toward the chin. Lower the head toward the trunk.

Keep the right thumb near the right nostril. Place the right ring and little fingers on the left side of the nose. Position the fingertips just below the nasal bone and above the fatty tissue, inhale through both nostrils. Empty the lungs completely through the right nostril. Control the aperture of the right nostril with the inner side of the right thumb, away from the nail. Now inhale slowly, steadily, and deeply through the right nostril. Control the aperture with the tip of the right thumb near the nail. Fill the lungs to the brim, which is pūraka. Completely block the left nostril using the ring and little fingers during this inhalation. After full inhalation, completely block the right nostril with pressure from the thumb. Release the pressure of the ring and little fingers on the left nostril. Readjust the ring and little fingers on the outer edge of the left nostril. Keep the ring and little fingers parallel to the septum. Exhale slowly, steadily, and deeply through the left nostril. Empty the lungs completely, which is rechaka. Exert pressure from the inner sides of the tips of the ring and little fingers, away from the nails. After full exhalation through the left nostril, change the pressure on the left nostril by adjusting the fingers. In the changed position, the tips of the ring and little fingers nearer the nails exert the pressure. Now inhale through the left nostril slowly, steadily, and deeply. Fill the lungs to the brim, which is pūraka. After full inhalation through the left nostril, block it. Exhale through the right nostril. Adjust the pressure of the right thumb on the right nostril as stated previously. This completes one cycle. Perform eight to ten cycles at a stretch. After the final inhalation through the left nostril you can exhale through both nostrils to complete the sequence. Conclude by lying down in Savasana.",

Then, only attempt retention of breath after full inhalation. Start the retention gradually. In the beginning, keep the ratio time for inhalation, retention, and exhalation at one to one half to one. Very slowly increase the proportions to one to three quarters to one. After this is firmly established, attempt one to one to one. Only after mastering this, increase the proportion of retention so as to achieve the ratio of one to one to one. Do not attempt restraint of breath after full exhalation until you have achieved the desired ratio of one to one to one in inhalation, retention, and exhalation. Do not do both retentions together in the beginning. Practice retention after full inhalation and restraint after full exhalation separately or alternately. Practice retentions first by interspersing them after two or three cycles of deep breathing with inhalation and exhalation alone. Start with three retentions after full inhalation and three restraints after full exhalation. Increase the number of retentions very gradually.",

    "technique": "Dhyāna means absorption. It is the art of self-study, reflection, keen observation, or the search for the Infinite within. It is the observation of the physical processes of the body, the study of mental states, and profound contemplation. It means looking inward to one’s innermost being. Dhyāna is the discovery of the Self.\n\nWhen the powers of the intellect and the heart are harmoniously blended, this is dhyāna. All creativity proceeds from it, and its good and beautiful results benefit mankind.\n\nDhyāna is like deep sleep, but with a difference. The serenity of deep sleep comes as a result of unconsciously forgetting one’s identity and individuality, whereas meditation brings serenity that is alert and conscious throughout. The sādhaka remains a witness (sākṣī) to all activities. Chronological and psychological time have no existence in deep sleep or in total absorption. In sleep, the body and mind recover from wear and tear and feel fresh upon waking. In meditation, the sādhaka experiences illumination.\n\nDhyāna is the full integration of the contemplator, the act of contemplation, and the object contemplated, becoming one. The distinction between the knower, the instrument of knowledge, and the object known vanishes. The sādhaka becomes vibrant, alert, and poised. He becomes free from hunger, thirst, sleep, and sex, as well as from desire, anger, greed, infatuation, pride, and envy. He is unassailable by the dualities of body and mind, or mind and Self. His vision reflects his true Self like a well-polished mirror. This is Ātma-darśana, the reflection of the Soul.\n\nJesus said that man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. Pondering upon the meaning of life, man becomes convinced that within his soul dwells a force or light far greater than himself. Yet in his walk of life he is beset by many cares and doubts. Caught in the environment of artificial civilisation, he develops a false sense of values. His words and actions run counter to his thoughts. Bewildered by these contradictions, he realises that life is full of opposites—pain and pleasure, sorrow and joy, conflict and peace. Seeing these polarities, he strives to attain balance and to find a state of stability so that he may experience freedom from pain, sorrow, and conflict. In his search he discovers the three noble paths of knowledge (jñāna), work (karma), and worship (bhakti), which teach him that his inner light is the only guide leading to mastery over his own life. To reach this inner light, he turns to meditation or dhyāna.\n\nTo have a clear notion of the true natures of man, the world, and God, the sādhaka should study the sacred books (śāstras). Then he can distinguish the real from the unreal. Knowledge of these three truths (tattva-traya)—the soul (cit), the world (acit), and God (Īśvara)—is essential for one who seeks liberation. Such knowledge gives insight into life’s problems and their solutions and strengthens spiritual practice. Yet knowledge acquired by reading alone will not lead to liberation. It is through courage and unshakable faith in the teachings of the sacred books, and by putting them into practice until they become part of daily life, that the sādhaka gains freedom from the domination of the senses. Knowledge of the scriptures and sādhana are the two wings by which the sādhaka flies towards liberation.\n\nMan is drawn between two paths. One drags him downwards toward the fulfilment of voluptuous desires and sense gratification, leading to bondage and destruction; the other guides him upwards toward purity and realisation of his inner Self. Desires fog the mind and veil the true Self. It is the mind alone that leads to bondage or to liberation. It is reason or intelligence that either controls the mind or allows itself to be dominated.\n\nAn untrained mind flies aimlessly in all directions. The practice of meditation brings it to a state of stability and then directs it to proceed from imperfect knowledge to perfection. The sādhaka’s mind and intelligence work as an integrated team led by will-power. He finds harmony between his thoughts, speech, and actions. His stilled mind and intelligence burn like a lamp in a windless place, with simplicity, innocence, and illumination.\n\nMan has great potentialities that lie dormant within him. His body and mind are like fallow land lying untilled and unsown. A wise farmer ploughs his land (kṣetra), provides it with water and fertiliser, plants the best seeds, carefully tends the crops, and ultimately reaps a good harvest. To the sādhaka, his body, mind, and intellect are the field he ploughs with energy and right action. He sows the finest seeds of knowledge, waters them with devotion, and tends them with unrelenting spiritual discipline to reap the harvest of harmony and peace. He then becomes the wise owner (kṣetrajña) of his field, and his body becomes a sacred place. The germination of good thoughts (savicāra), planted by sound logic (savitarka), brings clarity to the mind and wisdom to the intellect (sasmita). He becomes an abode of joy (āda), as his whole being is filled with the Lord.\n\nThe journey to the moon and outer space demanded years of rigorous training and discipline, deep study, research, and preparation. The inward journey of man to reach his inner Self demands the same relentless effort. Years of discipline and long, uninterrupted practice of the moral and ethical principles of yama and niyama, training of the body through āsana and prāṇāyāma, restraint of the senses through pratyāhāra and dhāraṇā, ensure the growth of the mind and inner awareness—dhyāna and samādhi.\n\nDhāraṇā (derived from the root dhr, meaning “to hold” or concentration) is like a lamp that is covered and does not light up the area outside. When the cover is removed, the lamp illuminates the whole area. This is dhyāna—the expansion of consciousness. The sādhaka acquires a unified mind and maintains a dynamic, unfading awareness in its pristine purity. Like oil in seeds and fragrance in flowers, the soul permeates the whole body.\n\nThe lotus is symbolic of meditation. It symbolises purity. Its quiet beauty has given it a prime place in Indian religious thought. It is connected with most Hindu deities and their seats in the cakras. The stage of meditation is like a lotus bud hiding its inner beauty while awaiting transformation into a fully blossomed lotus. As the bud opens to reveal its splendour, so too the sādhaka’s inner light is transformed and transfigured by meditation. He becomes an enlightened soul (siddha) and an inspired sage. He lives in the eternal now—the present—without yesterdays or tomorrows.\n\nThis state of the sādhaka is one of passivity known as manolaya (manas meaning mind, and laya meaning absorption or merging). He has fully marshalled his intelligence (prajñā) and energy (prāṇa) to prevent the intrusion of external thoughts. His state is full of dynamic alertness. When both internal and external thoughts are stilled and silenced, there is no waste of physical, mental, or intellectual energy.\n\nDhyāna is a subjective experience of an objective state. It is difficult to describe in words, for words are inadequate. The delight experienced at the first bite of a delicious mango is indescribable; so it is with meditation. In meditation there is no seeking or searching, for the soul and the goal have become one. The nectar of infinity must be tasted; the abundant grace of the Lord within must be experienced. Then the individual soul (jīvātman) becomes one with the Universal Soul (Paramātman).\n\nThe sādhaka experiences the fullness sung by the Upaniṣads:\n\nThat is full; this is full.\nFrom fullness comes fullness.\nEven when fullness is taken from fullness,\nfullness remains.",

    "description": "Half Lotus (Ardha Padmasana) is a yoga and meditation pose where one foot rests on the opposite thigh, while the other leg stays tucked underneath, requiring significant hip external rotation and flexibility, with benefits like calming the mind, improving circulation, and strengthening the back, but it's crucial to avoid knee pain by using props like cushions or blocks and practicing hip openers first. Proper execution involves flexing the knee, externally rotating the hip, bringing the heel towards the pelvis, and keeping the spine straight, using support to prevent strain.",
    "technique": "Start in Staff Pose (Dandasana) sitting with the legs straight and the spine long. Bend the left knee fully and bring the foot toward the body. Gently guide the foot by externally rotating the hip so the outer edge of the foot rests on the opposite thigh, nestling the heel into the hip crease near the navel. Tuck the right foot under the left thigh, allowing the left knee to descend toward the floor. Maintain a tall spine and relaxed shoulders while pulling the navel gently inward. Use a cushion under the hips if necessary to ensure the lower back does not round.",

    "description": "Digital Pranayama (Nasa Mudra)\nThe art of using the fingers (digits) to refine the flow of air. This technique focuses on the subtle placement and movement of the hand to control the nostrils without disturbing the equilibrium of the head or neck.\nEffects: Develops sensitivity in the fingertips, ensures an even flow of air through the nasal passages, and prepares the practitioner for the advanced stages of controlled respiration.",
    "technique": "Sit with the spine erect. Raise the right hand and bend the index and middle fingers toward the palm (Vishnu Mudra). Place the thumb on the right side of the nose and the ring and little fingers on the left side, just below the nasal bone where the flesh is soft. The art of placement requires the fingers to move like a balance scale—as one side opens, the other narrows with subtle, firm, yet light pressure. Ensure the fingers do not pull the nose to either side; the bridge of the nose should remain centered. The elbow should be relaxed and tucked close to the chest to keep the hand steady and the arm from fatiguing.",
